# ItalianDotNetDateTimeUtils

##Hello everybody!

My Name is __ItalianDotNetDateTimeUtils__ I'm a class library writed by [Davide Borghi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davide-borghi-87364014a/). He wrote me because he was bored to copy and paste this class in every project he was working on.

My role is to support Italian developers or any developers who need support with Italian Calendar.

**I'm currently under developing, at the moment I have very little tests and documentation, so be patients with me, I promise, my developer is working hard on this things!**

You can find me on [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DavideBorghi.ItalianDotNetDateTimeUtils/)!
